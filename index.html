    <div><h3>Other common symptoms of nux vomica</h3>
   <h6 style="color: red">Antioxidant Effects</h6> 
A Chinese medical study published in a Journal showed that Nux vomica has different compounds that make it an antioxidant substance.

The research also showed that Nux vomica might offer some benefits over human health. The same study confirmed that brucine and strychnine, two active compounds in nux vomica, are dangerous in high doses.

<h6 style="color: red">Pain Relief</h6>
A 2015 study showed that extract prepared from the leaves of nux vomica contains potential analgesic or pain-relieving properties. The antioxidants in the plant are reasoned for this effect.

Pain-Relief-nux-vomica

But, we should know that Homeopathy treatments use nux vomica seeds, not the leaves.

Some other researchers are working on finding how to effectively remove the effect of strychnine from the plant seeds. They concluded the research with a statement that removing the poisonous chemical compound improves nux vomica seeds’ analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.

Researchers said the anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects of nux vomica are probably due to the presence of brucine. When tested with animal subjects, brucine in nux vomica reduced markers of pain and swelling. However, more studies and tests are required to derive this effect of nux vomica in humans.

<h6 style="color: red"> Diabetes </h6>
A study in 2012 tried to evaluate and confirm if nux vomica can be used to treat diabetes. Researchers found that nux vomica seed extract helped control sugar levels in the blood than other substances in animal models.

<h6 style="color: red"> Alcoholism</h6> 
The available study results about the effect of nux vomica as a homeopathic medicine include preliminary research published in 2002 in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. This journal showed that nux vomica has promising effects on treating alcoholism.

Alcoholism-nux-vomica

In an animal study, the researchers found that animals induced with nux vomica diluted preparation experienced a major reduction in their alcohol intake. But, as of now, there are studies with evidence to prove the same effect on humans. 

<h6 style="color: red"> Cancer</h6>
Many preliminary studies on human body cell structure found that nux vomica may fight cancer probably by encouraging apoptosis, which is a type of induced cell death that is needed for preventing the development of cancer cells.

<h6 style="color: red"> Constipation</h6> 
Nux vomica is often recommended in homeopathy medicine for constipation problems. According to the National Center for Homeopathy, nux vomica is used to stop a laxative habit where the person experiences difficulties in bowel movements without inducing a laxative. One dose per day before sleep for certain days is typically recommended.

Constipation-nux-vomica

However, there are not enough studies to determine this effect of nux vomica for constipation. 

<h6 style="color: red"> Common Cold</h6> 
Influenza or flu is the most common health condition that worsens a day. Though it is not considered a pandemic, anyone who gets the flu wants to get rid of it quickly because of the weakness, tiredness, and body pain it causes. 

Common-Cold-nux-vomica

In some cases, nux vomica is used with other herbs to cure flu symptoms. The National Center for Homeopathy said that nux vomica is good medicine for gastric flu with diarrhea and vomiting.

Currently, studies established that stem bark of nux vomica plants contains flavonoids and antiviral properties, which helps itself to be powerful medicine for viral diseases like viruses or flu. But, homeopathy medicine uses its seeds, not stem bark.

<h6 style="color: red"> Urinary Tract Infection </h6> 
Nux vomica is used for Urinary Tract Infections, aka UTIs with the following symptoms.

If you feel irritation in the bladder and have a constant feeling of urination passing a small amount, this remedy is recommended.
When you feel burning pain, the bladder, and itching sensation in urethra during urination.
These UTIs symptoms may be relieved by hot baths or other warmth treatments.

Urinary-Tract-Infection-nux-vomica

Research about this effect of Nux vomica is limited. A pilot study showed the potential impact of homeopathic medicines like nux vomica with other treatment methods on treating UTIs in people with injuries in spinal cords. The available studies on this effect are small and have no further evidence.

<h6 style="color: red"> Insomnia</h6> 
Insomnia, the most common sleeping disorder that affects almost 10% of adults. Maryland University Medical Center lists nux vomica with other homeopathic remedies for treating insomnia, especially in the cases with below conditions.

If insomnia is caused by anxiety, irritability, anger, excessive use of caffeine, drugs, or alcohol. 
This specific homeopathy medicine is suitable for people who wake up early in the morning, and for children who lose sleep due to little disturbances and often wake up by frightened dreams of fights or school.
Insomnia caused as side effects of taking severe medications can be treated with nux vomica.

<h6 style="color: red">Lower Back Pain</h6> 
Lower back pain is considered one of the modern-day health conditions caused by constant sitting, lack of workout, and more that affects the day to day routine and sleep of a person.
 Nux vomica can treat various health conditions, including:
